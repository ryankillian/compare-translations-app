Unlike many subsequent reprints and common digital versions (such as Project Gutenberg), the first edition preserves Pope's intended text and includes his extensive scholarly notes. The text used for the samples on this site is taken from a transcribed digital version provided by Michigan University (see 'Sample Source'). While this source offers recommended access to the first edition's text and notes, the most complete reading experience comes from a high-definition digital scan of the first edition. Versions available via platforms like HathiTrust are particularly recommended as they preserve the original 18th-century printing and typography.",
