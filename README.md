# Compare Translations

A web application to help you choose which English translation of literary classics best fits your personal reading preference.

## üéØ Purpose

Navigating the many translations of works like _The Iliad_ or _The Odyssey_ can be challenging. This tool aims to simplify that decision by allowing users to:

- Directly compare brief, anonymous text passages from different translators side-by-side.
- Vote for the style they prefer.
- View results based on their votes to identify translators whose style consistently resonates with them.

## ‚úÖ Core Features

- Side-by-side anonymous passage comparison for selected works.
- Voting mechanism to indicate preference.
- Local storage of voting history and preference statistics per book.
- Information page for available translators for each work.

**Currently Featuring:**

- _The Iliad_
- _The Odyssey_

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Framework:** SvelteKit (with Svelte 5)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Client-Side Storage:** Browser `localStorage` (for user votes and preferences)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure & Page Types

The site utilizes different SvelteKit features for page rendering and data loading:

- **`src/routes/`**

  - `+page.svelte`: **Homepage.**
    - Static content with client-side dynamic elements.
    - `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` set directly in the component.
  - `about/+page.svelte` & `about/+page.ts`: **About Page.**
    - Static content.
    - `+page.ts` provides `title` and `description` for SSR via the root layout.
  - `contact/+page.svelte` & `contact/+page.ts`: **Contact Page.**
    - Client-side form submission logic.
    - `+page.ts` provides `title` and `description` for SSR via the root layout.
  - `+layout.svelte`: **Root Layout.**
    - Provides global structure (e.g., footer).
    - Handles templating for `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` based on data from `+page.ts` files or page-level defaults.

- **`src/routes/books/[book]/`**

  - `+layout.svelte`: **Book-Specific Layout.**
    - Provides navigation (Vote, Results, Translators) and breadcrumbs for a specific book.
  - `+page.svelte` & `+page.ts`: **Book Overview Page.**
    - Displays a notice about site status.
    - `+page.ts` provides `title`, `description`, and book name for SSR.
  - `vote/+page.svelte` & `vote/+page.ts`: **Passage Comparison (Vote) Page.**
    - Core interactive feature.
    - `+page.ts` has `export const ssr = false;` - its `load` function runs client-side to fetch passage and translator data.
    - `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` are set dynamically within `vote/+page.svelte` due to client-side data loading.
  - `results/+page.svelte` & `results/+page.ts`: **Results Page.**
    - Displays user's local voting history and statistics (from `localStorage`).
    - `+page.ts` provides `title`, `description`, and book name for SSR. Main data is client-side.
  - `translators/+page.svelte` & `translators/+page.ts`: **Translators List Page.**
    - `+page.ts` loads translator data (from local JSON files) and provides `title` and `description` for SSR.

- **`src/lib/`**

  - `components/`: Reusable Svelte components (e.g., `LinkButton.svelte`, `ComparisonPassageCard.svelte`).
  - `data/`:
    - `books.ts`: Defines available books.
    - `duelHistory.svelte.ts`: Utilities for `localStorage` interaction.
    - `[book_slug]/meta.json`: Lists sample passage IDs for a book.
    - `[book_slug]/translators.json`: Contains metadata for translators of a book.
    - `[book_slug]/samples/`: Contains JSON files with text excerpts for comparison. _(Note: Most of these are kept private locally and only a few are in the public repository for demonstration)._
  - `stores/`: Client-side stores/caches (e.g., `translatorsStore.ts`).
  - `types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions (e.g., `getRandomDuel.ts`).

- **`static/`**: Favicons, default Open Graph image.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Addition of more sample passages for existing works.
- Expansion to include more literary works.
- Implementation of a global results table using a backend (e.g., Supabase) and potentially an Elo rating system for translations.
- User accounts (optional, for syncing results across devices).
